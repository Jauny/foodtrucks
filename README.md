### Stack
* Sinatra with Sprockets for Asset Pipeline
* Backbone
* Underscore
* Google Maps API v3
* sfdata.org

### Backend
App is pretty straight forward, and with a Backbone front-end, everything is taken care of in the front end.
Therefore, Sinatra seems to be a correct choice for it. Easy, simple, light, it's perfect to offer a really simple and straight-forward RESTful backend for such a small app.

### Front End
Learnt Backbone through the development of this app. Seemed to be a good front-end framework to allow a responsive and dynamic single page app, with trucks list and the map sharing the same models/collections.
